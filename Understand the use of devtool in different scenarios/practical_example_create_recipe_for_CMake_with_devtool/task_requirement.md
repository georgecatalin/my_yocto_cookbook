# Objective
Demonstrate the workflow to create a recipe based on CMake using devtools. Use for source in the recipe the following GitHub repo https://github.com/Swepz/Simple_CMake_Project.

This system_console_development.html is a terminal session log that documents the step-by-step process of creating and building a Yocto recipe for a CMake-based project using devtool. The main activities covered are:

1. **Yocto Build Environment Setup:**  
   - Navigating to the build directory and sourcing the Yocto environment.
   - Listing current layers and workspace contents.

2. **Layer and Workspace Management:**  
   - Removing and cleaning up the old workspace layer.
   - Adding a new recipe using devtool for a CMake project (Simple_CMake_Project from GitHub).
   - Confirming the workspace structure and files generated by devtool.

3. **Building the Recipe:**  
   - Running the build process for the new recipe.
   - Encountering and resolving build errors, specifically issues with the CMake install target and file paths.
   - Investigating the build and deployment directories.

4. **Deploying and Finishing the Recipe:**  
   - Deploying the built binary to a target.
   - Cleaning up (undeploying).
   - Finalizing the recipe and moving it to a persistent Yocto layer (meta-george) for future use.

5. **Verifying Layer Structure:**  
   - Checking the final file and directory structure to ensure the recipe is properly integrated.

**Purpose:**  
This log serves as a practical guide for creating, building, troubleshooting, and finalizing a Yocto recipe for a CMake project using devtool, including common errors and their solutions.
