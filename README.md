# A Yocto Cookbook
This repository contains a curated collection of Yocto Project resources, including custom recipes, configuration snippets, layer examples, build tips, and troubleshooting notes for **learning** or **refreshing** your **knowledge in Yocto Project**. 

## Personal Notes
The repository holds the necessary directories and files as meta-layers, recipes, .bbappend files etc, and also listings from the commands run on **console-line terminals** of the **development machine** and, the **target machine**, upon deployment. The aim is for the a straightforward understanding of the workflow. The listings of the command line carry also also errors, and their steps for debugging and resolution.
