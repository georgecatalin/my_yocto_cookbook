Demonstrate the use of a recipe to build a program that comprises multiple C files.

********

This documents the step-by-step process of building and troubleshooting a simple C project using Yocto without a Makefile. It shows terminal commands and outputs as the user:

Navigates directories and sets up the Yocto build environment.

Creates and adds custom layers and recipes in Yocto (specifically meta-advanced-calculator and its recipe final-calculator).

Adds multiple C source files (advanced-calculator.c and math-lib.c), and attempts to build them.

Encounters and resolves various build errors.
Updates the project structure and recipe files to fix issues (like missing license info, linking errors, and header includes).

Rebuilds the project multiple times, showing both errors and successful commands.

Checks the build outputs and navigates the build directories.


In summary:
practical_example_build_multiple_files_at_once_with_yocto_no_makefile/system_console.html is a detailed console output capturing the workflow and challenges of compiling multiple C files in Yocto (without using a Makefile), aimed at demonstrating the process and common pitfalls for Yocto beginners.
