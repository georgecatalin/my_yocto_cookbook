# Objective
Demonstrate the workflow to add a Python Package to an image using Yocto. As an example simulate the situations:
* the python package exists on the machine already ( ../poky/meta/recipes-devtools/python/ )
* the python package can be found in one of the meta layers of Open Embedded

## Searching for a precise python package on OpenEmbedded
* https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/master/recipes/?q=colorlog
